# To-Do-List Application

## Description

The To-Do-List is an application that allows users to enter a task and store it for future reference. It utilizes the full-stack, from client-side functions to storing data in a database using SQL. 

## Instructions

To add a list item, simply enter a task, choose a category, and click 'submit'. The 'filter list' dropdown at the top allows you to toggle between different categories to isolate a selected list from the rest. 

### Duration 

The total duration of the project was roughly ~16 hours. 

### What problem was solved? 

The theme of this project for me was plan plan plan. Writing out each method that was needed to accomplish building this application kept me organized and efficient as I moved on from one step to the next. Below is a quick list on the steps I took to ensure project satisfaction:

- Develop a project plan by outlining needs of the application
- Make a list of actionable items to execute and connect them to their corresponding file
- Produce framework for application and write structural code within index.html file
- Test connection on client-side, then test connection on server-side after initial set up
- Develop GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes between client, server, and database and test for accurate results
- Utilize bootstrap as the styling framework for the page
